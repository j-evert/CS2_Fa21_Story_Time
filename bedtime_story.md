# Our bedtime story

Part 1: It was a dark and stormy night...
We were out in the cold. And the rain had us chilled to the bone.

Part 2: We found a box. We loved the box. The box sheltered us from the rain.

Part 3: We used the box to help trap food. We caught food. 
But we want to cook it. It took days to catch food. The box is dry...
